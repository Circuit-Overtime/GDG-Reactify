## How It Works

### Card Component

The `Card.js` file contains the reusable **Card** component, styled using Tailwind CSS classes. It includes:

- A title and description
- Pricing information
- A call-to-action button

### Tailwind CSS Styling

The project's styles are managed using Tailwind CSS, which provides utility-first class names for rapid and responsive styling.
